## How to use
Go to your game "profiles" folder which by default in Windows is located at

Download the lastest release from here: https://github.com/Gonzalox/clean-profile-ets2-ats/releases

In the file you downloaded there will be the folder "**4D792050726F66696C65**"
* Euro Truck Simulator 2\profiles\4D792050726F66696C65
* American Truck Simulator\profiles\4D792050726F66696C65

Drag **4D792050726F66696C65** to your local profiles folder (depending on the game that corresponds) and you're all set!

Then run the game, there you select the "**My Profile**" profile. You will see the next savegame selection (if not please select **Save & Load** -> **Load Game** on the menu after completing the profile setup steps.):

If you only have the basegame (NO DLC Maps) select **Savegame for Base Map**
